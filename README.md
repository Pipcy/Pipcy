# Hi!

I am a college undergrad studying Computer Engineering who also likes to explore and work on cool project on my own timeðŸ˜†! Read more about me on [here](https://pippipi.com).

### Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, you will find:

- Games I made for Game Jams on itch.io with Unity (you can find my games' playable version [here](https://pipcy.itch.io)).
- Some iOS and Android apps.
- Some AI Projects I made in the past.

- ** Please note, if you're reading this now, the projects under this account are getting old. My most recent work that reflects my skills was done in my internship. Please refer to [my website](https://pippipi.com) for an up-to-date description of my most recent work.

Note that most of my projects were written during a time crunch (i.e. Game Jam) so some may not have the best formatting :(

If you would like to read about some development details for each project in a more readable format, you're welcome to visit my [website](https://pippipi.com).
