# Hi! This is Pipcy ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?
I am a college undergrad studying Computer Engineering who also likes to explore and work on cool project on my own timeðŸ˜†! Read more about me on [here](https://pippipi.com).

### Welcome to my Github page! In here, you will find:

- Games I made for Game Jams on itch.io with Unity (you can find my games' playable version [here](https://pipcy.itch.io)).
- Some iOS and Android apps.
- Some AI Projects I made in the past.

Note that most of my code were written during a time chrunch (i.e. Game jam) so some may not have the best formatting :(

If you would like to read about some development details for each project with a more readable format, you're welcome to visit my [website](https://pippipi.com).
